# Participate 

An app for democratic proposal-making.

It aims to facilitate citizen participation in public issues, with a laser-focus on proposals rather than noisy and many times endless debate. Debate is done *through* proposals - for example, dissenters have to make a counter-proposal to be heard. Other participants have to support a proposal in principle in order to suggest changes.

Representation is ensured for less involved participants through fluid delegation of support, in a [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy).

Participate is in early stages of development, moving towards a functional prototype to be deployed within the next few months, when a pilot will be run with a select group of proposal-makers, initially urban planners and water management specialists in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. 

Current features:
----------------------

* Facebook sign up and sign in
* Very simple proposal creation
* Listing proposals
* Supporting proposals

Next features on the roadmap:

* Creating counter-proposals
* Delegating support


Stack:
---------------

Participate consists of a front-end [Emberjs](http://emberjs.com) app (this repo), and a separate [backend Rails API app](http://github.com/oliverbarnes/participate-api).

Installation:
-------------

```
brew install watchman
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run the test suite, if everything is ok the build should go smoothly and tests should pass:

```
ember test
```

Running:
-------

You'll need to startup the API app first, so the Ember client can talk to it. [Follow the instructions](https://github.com/oliverbarnes/participate-api#bootstrapping-the-project) to install  and start it up, then come back here and run

```
ember server
```

Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
